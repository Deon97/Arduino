1) Power up your SIM900A module to respond to AT commands in auto-baud mode (AT+IPR=0). It means you must wire powerlines, do power-on sequence with PWRKEY etc.
2) Setup flashing tool — connect it to SIM900A, set default speed of 460800 baud, choose firmware to flash and press "start download" button to see “Power On/Reset Target” message.
3) Short NRESET (pin 16 if not available directly on your board) to GND for a moment. Right after it reboots flashing tool will start pushing data.
4) When flashing ends with “Download complete” power off SIM900A module. Note that reset will not work, disconnect power line and start power-on sequence once again.
5) Test by adding a sim card to your module, then make a call to that number. If all is fine, you should see "RING" in the serial console. 
   A visual test is to observe the onoard LED (not the power one) which flashes once every 2-3 seconds when SIM registered to network and once or twice per second when it did not.

Use the firmware from the bin folder, or download other firmware versions from: http://dostmuhammad.com/sim900-firmware-update-tutorials-appnotes/

AT Commands to enter pin and test version:
1) AT+CPIN?  (if response is +CPIN: SIM PIN then go to step 2 otherwise go to step 3)
2) AP+CPIN="your-pin-here"
3) AT+CGMR (display your firmware version)
